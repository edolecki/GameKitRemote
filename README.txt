Happy Valentines Day.

Hello. I'm Eric and I do a lot with GameKit - connecting different 
or the same iOS applications together in order to simulate different 
things or for games. Game Kit became available starting in iOS 4 and 
for OS X in 10.8. 

Note
====
At time connecting takes a while or may timeout. Even when connected 
you might find calls queuing up or slow to send. It's rare but it can 
happen - I've seen it happen every now and then.
